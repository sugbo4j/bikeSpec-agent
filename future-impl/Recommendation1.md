### future implementation

1. Selector Versioning System

   - Stores multiple CSS selectors per data field
   - Automatically falls back to working versions when changes detected
   - Proactive health checks against test products
   - Admin API for remote selector updates without redeployment

2. Resilience Patterns

   - Circuit breakers for retailer website outages
   - Proxy rotation to prevent IP blocking
   - Intelligent rate limiting

3. Monitoring & Alerting

   - Comprehensive logging
   - Email notifications for failures
   - Performance metrics dashboard

4. Compatibility Engine
   Automated tagging of compatible components using specification analysis

5. Scalability Features
   - Parallel Processing: Concurrent scraping of product pages
   - Selector Versioning: Adapt to website changes without redeployment
   - Auto-Scaling: Container-ready for cloud deployment

This architecture provides a maintainable foundation for continuous expansion of retailer coverage while ensuring data quality and system resilience. The selector versioning system is particularly crucial for minimizing maintenance overhead as it allows the scraper to automatically adapt to website changes.
